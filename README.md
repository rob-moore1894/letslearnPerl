# letslearnPerl
I am committing myself to learning Perl from scratch 
If you're reading this, looking at my progress, and have some special portions of Perl you believe I should look into, or some advice, please feel free to open an issue on this repository and let me know.  
I am using Padre IDE to write and test the scripts.  As of right now, I have yet to figure out how to push from Padre to GitHub onto this repository.  The code that you see, is copied and pasted directly onto GitHub.
Thank you!
